# ENIGMA MACHINE

The Enigma machine is a complex encryption machine used by the Germans
in the 2nd world war to encode messages. This is alca-
tuita from several components: \
`1. Plugboard: a physical board that swaps between certain letters.`

`2. Reflector: a physical card that swaps letters 2 by 2.` \
For example, if A is linked to D, then D -> (reflector) -> A and
A -> (reflector) -> D.

`3. Rotor: a mechanical wheel that contains a permutation of the 26 letters
of the alphabet, and a notch whose role is to rotate the wheel from the left.` \
Example: For Rotor1 we have \
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \
E K M F L G D Q V Z N T O W Y H X U S P A I B R C J, \
with notch on Q.

We want to build the logic behind the enigma machine to be able to encrypt
and decrypt messages.
The machine configuration is stored in a config[10][26] matrix as follows:
- lines 0 - 1 represent the configuration of the first rotor.
- lines 2 - 3 represent the configuration of the second rotor.
- lines 4 - 5 represent the configuration of the third rotor.
- lines 6 - 7 represent the configuration of the reflector.
- lines 8 - 9 represent the configuration of the plugboard.

## a) Putting the rotors in the initial position (5p):

To solve this task you have to implement the following function: \
`void rotate_x_positions(int x, int rotor, char config[10][26], int forward)`

where:

`x - the offset of the new position'

`rotor - the rotor on which the rotation is applied (indexing is done from 0!)'

`config - the configuration of the machine that you will have to modify'

`forward - direction of rotation' (if forward = 0 then it shifts to the left
x positions, if forward = 1 then it shifts to the right x positions).

The config matrix will be modified according to the rotor parameter.

Example: \
If the first 2 lines of the config matrix contain the configuration of the first rotor, for example \
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \
E K M F L G D Q V Z N T O W Y H X U S P A I B R C J \
and we apply the function like this: \
rotate_x_positions(3, 0, config, 0), then change these 2 lines in \
D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C \
F L G D Q V Z N T O W Y H X U S P A I B R C J E K M

## b) Encoding the message (20p):
To solve this task you have to implement the following function: \
`void enigma(char *plain, char key[3], char notches[3], char config[10][26], char *enc)`

where:

`plain - the text to be encrypted'

`key - the initial positions of the rotors (key[i] = the initial position of the rotor i)`

`notches - the initial notches of the rotors (notches[i] = the initial notch of the rotor i)`

`config - machine configuration'

`enc - the address to which you will have to write the encrypted text'

Attention: before reading the character from the plain, the 3rd rotor must be turned
with 1 position (left shift) and its initial position increased (alphabet
is circular, so if we increase Z it becomes A). If the current position
BEFORE ROTATING the rotor is equal to its notch, then we will also rotate
the rotor on its left with 1 position (this will be done for everyone
rotors less the first);

Example 1 : key = "QWE", notches = "AAE" => key = "QXF"

Example 2: key = "QWE", notches = "AWE" => key = "RXF"
